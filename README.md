# Description

A simple and easy to use website created using HTML5 and CSS to list all the projects created by me as a begineer. I believe that best way to learn any tech is to get your hands dirty with the code. Learn by doing. This is the reason why I prefer to create project whenever I learn a new technology using that technology and my previous knowledge. This website will list all such projects.

The website also has a dedicated page for blogs where there are links to all the blogs written by me till date.
